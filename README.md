Introduction
The Neo Orrery project is a digital simulation designed to visualize the orbits of the planets in the solar system. This project offers an intuitive and interactive interface that allows users to view the planets orbiting the Sun in a way that's both informative and engaging. The term "orrery" refers to a mechanical model of the solar system, and this modern version takes that concept into the digital age with cutting-edge technologies.

Whether you’re a space enthusiast, an educator, or simply someone curious about the universe, Neo Orrery provides an excellent platform to explore the mechanics of our solar system.

Features
Interactive Solar System Model: Watch the planets orbit the Sun in real-time.
Accurate Orbital Simulation: The simulation uses accurate planetary data to show realistic movements.
Zoom and Rotation: Adjust the view to get a closer look at any celestial body.
Planet Info: Click on any planet to learn more about it (e.g., size, distance from the Sun, etc.).
User-friendly Interface: Simple controls that make navigation easy for all users.
Real-time Animation: The planets move in real time, simulating their actual speed and distance.
How to Use
Start the Application
Navigate to the website and the Neo Orrery will load automatically.

Interact with the Model

Zoom In/Out: Use your mouse scroll or the zoom buttons to get a closer look at the planets.
Rotate View: Click and drag on the screen to rotate the view of the solar system.
Click on Planets: Click on any planet to get more information, including size, distance from the Sun, and orbital characteristics.
Explore the Solar System:
Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the controls, feel free to explore the solar system, adjusting the view and observing how the planets move around the Sun.

Educational Use:
This tool is perfect for educational purposes. Teachers can use it to demonstrate the movement of planets and the scale of the solar system in an engaging way.

Technologies Used
JavaScript: For creating the interactive simulation and real-time animation.
Three.js: A powerful 3D JavaScript library used for rendering the planetary orbits.
WebGL: For rendering 3D graphics within the browser.
CSS: For styling the interface and providing a smooth user experience.
